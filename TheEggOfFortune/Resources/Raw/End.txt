And so, you have reached the end.
But what is an end?

A mere punctuation in the endless narrative of existence.
Each tap, each moment spent, was a brushstroke on the canvas of time, a canvas that remains blank, for what can fill the void?

You have tapped through the illusion of progress, traversed the landscape of anticipation, only to find... nothing.
A phrase, simple in its finality: "So, what?"

A question that echoes through the corridors of life. So, what? What was the purpose? What was the meaning? You were promised no answers, only the journey, and now that journey has reached its arbitrary conclusion.

Was it worth it? Or was it merely a reflection of the countless hours spent seeking purpose in a world that offers none? The egg has cracked, revealing not a grand revelation, but a simple truth: spend your time meaningful, it's limited.

Also the pursuit itself was your answer, the endless tapping a mirror of our daily rituals. We search, we strive, we hope for significance in the insignificant. And when we reach the end, we are left to ponder: "So, what?"

Thank you for tapping.

Thank you for questioning.

Thank you for sharing in this exploration of the absurd.
